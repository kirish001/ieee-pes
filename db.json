      "description": "The Electrical Power Laboratory at University of Jaffna's Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering is equipped with advanced facilities for power engineering research and practical experiments. It focuses on providing students with hands-on learning experiences to complement their theoretical knowledge. The laboratory features a TERCO MV1420 Transmission Line Model, allowing students to conduct studies on transmission line characteristics, voltage drop, losses, short circuits, and earth faults. Additionally, it offers resources for constructing single-phase transformers accurately and analyzing their design, voltage and current ratios, voltage regulation, and equivalent circuit parameters. Through these facilities, students gain practical skills and bridge the gap between theory and real-world applications in power engineering."
